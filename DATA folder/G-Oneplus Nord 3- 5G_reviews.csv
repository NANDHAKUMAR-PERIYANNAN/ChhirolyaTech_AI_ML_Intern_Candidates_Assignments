Oneplus Nord 3- 5G,5,"I have been using this mobile oneplus nord 3 for 2 week and this is my experience
1. Display : is very good and can go to decent brightness. Watching videos is a good experience. 120fps mode looks good too. Not watched much hdr content on it. Also not sure how 120fps works with games.
2. Battery : It easily lasts full day of medium usage, and with 80 watt charger included battery charges from 0 to 100 in around 40 min. So battery is not a issue. Earlier used to charge my previous phone overnight and now only need to charge it in morning for around 30 min. Another thing battery loss during night is very low, like around 5 percent max.
3. Performance : it handles all normal work easily and can easily handle multiple apps. Haven't done much gaming but the little gaming i did was good, cannot say anything for long gaming session.
4 Connectivity : No network issue faced yet, 5g work with both jio and airtel network when 5g network is available.
5 Sound : Speaker is decent, not great, Dolby atoms works good with headphones and earbuds. Voice while calling is also good.",16,1
Oneplus Nord 3- 5G,5,"I'm fully satisfied with
1. Camera clarity.
2. Display n performance is like Butter  
3. Speaker is also loud n clear compare to any other phones.
4. Design - Lightweght
5. Charging is very fast.

Only thing is Battery need to be 6000mah atleast .Still 5000mah is good for daily use. As it is charging very fast no need to worry.

I give 4.5/5*",232,70

Oneplus Nord 3- 5G,4,"1.Camera is good.
2. Battery gives 5 to 6 hr in multitasking.
3.Display quality is awesome.
4.Duel speaker Sound is wonderful.
5.Performance gives you max level in dimensity 9000 .
You can play any game like makhhan . Gives 90 fps in pubg but 90 fps is not optimized . 60 fps is more than enough in gaming compare to other device in this range .

6. One more important thing . If you are worried about heating issue . Trust me it doesn't heats up in Normal use even in normal gaming also .

It very properly maintains its temperature. No heating issue for dimensity 9000.

Slightly heats up when it is connected to charger. I don't think ki it's an issue because it takes only 30 mins for full charge.


Don't worry about heating. Compare to other processors in this range it is cooler than them .

Best deal in this price range .",15,3
