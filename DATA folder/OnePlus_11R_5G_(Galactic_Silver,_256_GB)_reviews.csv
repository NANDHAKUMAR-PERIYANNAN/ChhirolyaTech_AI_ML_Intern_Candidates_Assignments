5.Design is one of the major highlight of this phone.Really Excellent design.",7,0
"OnePlus 11R 5G (Galactic Silver, 256 GB)",4,"Fully satisfied with the product. It is a true flagship killer phone. Main Camera is very good but other two cameras are average. Photos in daylight as well as in night are great. I would rate camera 4 out of 5.

Performance is top notch with snapdragon 8 gen 1 processor. I would rate processor 4.5 out of 5.

Battery backup is great. It lasts almost a day with moderate usage. I would rate battery 4.7 out of 5

Charging is awesome. 100 watt charger fully charges the phone in around half an hour. I would rate charging speed 5 out of 5.

Built quality is great. But back panel is slippery so back cover is essential.

Display of the phone is very bright and crisp. I would rate it 5 out of 5.

I would suggest everyone to buy this smartphone if one would compromise somewhat with secondary cameras.",14,2

Overall good phone, performance, built quality, display, oxygen os, call quality, network reception, sound, battery backup, charging speed, all are good, except the camera department. Front camera has a face beauty mode, which does not work properly. It shows smooth skin while capturing but then makes the skin look rough again after capturing, so it just spoils the joy of taking selfies. Retouch/beautify during video call option is disabled in this phone. So, without these basic and essential camera features I don't recommend anybody to buy this phone.",3,0

"OnePlus 11R 5G (Galactic Silver, 256 GB)",5,"Hardware specs are fantastic . Great display ,
fast performance ,
battery holds up pretty well
Good camera
The reason for a 3 star rating is the software .
Coming from a Samsung phone this UI does not feel premium tbh . I have a few issues with it
- the notifications panel is a big inconvenience . You cannot drag to collapse or expand . You have to click the tiny down arrow on the corner of the notification. Google news does display properly on the notification panel .
Swiping right clears the notification but sweeping left doesn't . If swiping left you have to do it twice to clear
- 15s skip forward on spotify doesn't skip forward when on lockscreen . It rewinds 15s
- colour picker from wallpaper doesn't seem to work properly . It does not matter which points you choose only one colour gets applied everywhere

Just mentioning some issues i have been facing . Stuff you cannot find on a spec sheet . Hope they fix all these in the upcoming updates",24,12

"OnePlus 11R 5G (Galactic Silver, 256 GB)",5,"I was One plus 7 pro user.
Display quality is not that satisfactory because it have 451 ppi only.
Primary 50 mp camera is good but another 2 (wild angle and macro) is only 8 and 2.
Night vision camera is good again only 50mp camera works satisfactory rest 2 cameras are useless I will say.
The processor and speed is mind-blowing.
Selfie camera is average.
Battery charging speed is incredible It charges 100% only in 20-25 minutes.
That work around 7 8 hours heavy performance and normal usage you can use upto entire day.
Game is experience is good.
Phone built quality and comfort is good.
If you are looking under 50k this is a good phone(16/256gb)
Feature (display,camera, processor) wise One plus 11 is better than one plus 11r but obviously you have to pay more extra bucks.
I will rate
