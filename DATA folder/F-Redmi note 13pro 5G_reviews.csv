Display is super amazing , no other phone can beat it.
Cristal clear and super dynamic crispy display with 68Billion colors. Truly supports Dolby vision and HDR.

Sound quality is awesome, you can enjoy Dolby Atmos.

Mediatek Dimensity 7200 ultra is working like beast. You can play BGMI and Free Fire with HDR setting.

Camera is good , you can click very good quality Portrait mode photos and night mode photos.

Battery backup is decent and 120 watt charging is just superfast. You can charge 0 to 100 in just 25 minutes.

IP68 with Gorilla Glass Victus means 100% protection from damage.

F-Redmi note 13pro 5G,3,"Falls short in several aspects, including its build quality, software optimization, and camera performance.
Issues with overheating, laggy performance, and frequent software glitches.
The camera quality often disappoints, producing subpar photos and videos in various lighting conditions. Overall, considering the competition in its price range.

The Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus fails to deliver the expected level of performance and reliability.",3,2
F-Redmi note 13pro 5G,3,"After using this product for two days I'm sharing my feedback.
Pros:
1. Good looking (that's it)
2. Performance is quite good
Cons:
1. The company claims that this Phone will fully charge in 19 mins but in reality it's taking around 50 mins to fully charge the phone. The battery will drain too fast even though the phone is on standby and you will get heating issues as well.
2. Got a scratch on screen after rubbing the phone on the bedsheet. So not sure what the use of victus glass is.
3. Inshort, The Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus falls short in various aspects, making it a regrettable choice for users. The camera quality is subpar, producing grainy and lackluster images even in well-lit conditions. The promised features feel more like a marketing gimmick, with underwhelming performance that fails to justify the higher price tag.

Additionally, the battery life is a letdown, struggling to last through a day of moderate usage despite the touted enhancements. The device's build quality is questionable, exhibiting a plasticky feel that lacks the premium touch expected in this price range. The UI experience is marred by bloatware, making the overall user interface cluttered and cumbersome.

Furthermore, the absence of significant innovations or standout features leaves the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus trailing behind competitors in the market. It's a disappointing investment for those seeking a reliable and feature-rich smartphone experience.",792,203

*Superb design and looks.
*Amazing camera. Superb in outdoor photography but not that great in low light photography.
Superb battery. No heating issues, a day's backup with moderate usage on 5G, gets fully charged under 20 minutes.
Superb performance. I have installed 150 apps which includes 20 games like BGMI, Genshin Impact etc but no lagging issues and no heating issues as well. Smooth switching between apps.
Plenty of storage. I have turned off my cloud backups as you will never run out of space. 512 GB version gives you a lot of memory. I use my phone as a backup hard drive for my laptop.
